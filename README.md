# Yet Another Mastodon App
It doesn't have a proper name yet, but this is another Mastodon app. Why does it exist? Well, because frankly, Android users don't have a massive amount of choices for Mastodon clients. Sure, you've got a few, but that's it: a few. And some of them may not necessarily be in development anymore. Well -- YAMA sets out to change all of that. By building specifically for all those Android users out there looking for an app that is truly worth their time.

And best of all, YAMA is being built in the open: by the community, for the community. Transparency and a free environment define what the fediverse is capable of, and this app is no exception.

## How can I help?
Well, you can certainly help us by contributing code, or by doing one of these things:
- [submit your ideas](https://github.com/sladewatkins/YetAnotherMastodonApp/discussions/categories/ideas)
- spread the word about this app and help get it off the ground!

## Contributing code
We'll have formal documentation on this once we're ready to start development.
